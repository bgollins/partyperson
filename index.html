          <p> Seems like you might have an issue with keeping your house clean, and that you're the type of person that only has ketchup as a consistent staple in their fridge. It is actually quite obvious that you <strong>should not invite anyone over</strong>, but if you turn down the lights, pick up a few tealight candles, power up that big screen TV, and order in the best pizza in town... you could get away with having one lucky person over. For a few hours. As long as your couch isn't disgusting and they sanitize themselves after leaving your place. Good luck.</p>

          <p>Sounds like your hippie self should probably plan a welcoming gathering at your home. Maybe even host a quick yoga session and write in your gratitude journals before breaking gluten-free bread! But, in order to accommodate all of the different eating restrictions, juice cleanses, and additive-avoidant preferences, it will just be easiest to have everyone bring their own food. And probably not share. Because do you really think anyone else wants your <strong>meat-free haggis?!</strong></p>
