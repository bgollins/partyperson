## Description

_This simple webpage uses the form feature of bootstrap to create a "quiz" for the user to engage with. After using dropdown menus to answer 5 questions, the questions disappear to have a result replace them, describing what type of party to host. The results are calculated with simple if/else statements in javascript._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the project to your desktop_
* _Open the index.html file in your web browser_
* _Answer the questions_
* _Learn what type of party you should host (with some sass)!_
